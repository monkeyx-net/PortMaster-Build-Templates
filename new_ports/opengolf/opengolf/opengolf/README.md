# Open Golf

## Notes

A 3D minigolf game with 20 holes. Thanks to [Michael Gerdes](https://github.com/mgerdes/Open-Golf) for creating the game (MIT). Models are from [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/assets) (CC0).

This port builds the `portmaster` branch of [monkeyx-net/Open-Golf](https://github.com/monkeyx-net/Open-Golf/tree/portmaster), which runs the game on SDL2 with OpenGL ES 3.0 and adds gamepad controls. Move between menu buttons with the D-pad or left stick and press A or Start. To putt, hold A, pull back with the D-pad or left stick to set the direction and power, and release A.

Progress is saved in `storage.json` in the port folder.

## Controls
